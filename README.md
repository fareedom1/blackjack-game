# Blackjack Game in Python

This is a simple, text-based Blackjack game written in Python. You play against four automated opponents — one dealer and three NPCs — who each hit a random number of times.

## Features
- Randomized card drawing
- Basic Blackjack rules (Hit, Stand, Bust, Win)
- NPC opponents with simple logic
- End-of-game scoreboard showing results

## How to Play
1. Open a terminal and navigate to the project folder.
2. Run the game:
python blackjack.py
3. You'll be dealt two random cards.
4. Type `HIT` to draw another card or `STAND` to end your turn.
5. The NPCs play automatically, and the winner is announced at the end.

## Requirements
- Python 3.x

No additional libraries are required.

## Future Improvements
- Seeing what the dealer has in hand while player decides to hit or stand
- Smarter AI for NPCs
- Card suit and face card support (e.g. King, Queen, Ace)
- Betting system with virtual currency
